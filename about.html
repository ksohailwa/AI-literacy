    <h1>About the AI Toolbox Project</h1>

    <br>

    <p>

      This website was developed as part of our Bachelor's project
      in the summer semester 2025 at the University of Duisburg-Essen.
      </p>
      Its purpose is to promote AI literacy among students, educators, and the general public.
      <p>
      Our toolbox includes games and educational tools designed to train various competencies based on well-known
      AI literacy frameworks.
    </p>
      The project is carried out by the students:
      <br>
      <br> Khan Sohail, Kevin Flotow, Mohammed Rezazahedi, Rabia Karabulut, Tharani Uruthirakumar and Gousiha Rammohan</br> 
      <br>under the expert guidance of our professor: Irene Choutna.
      <p>
      Together, we researched frameworks, collected useful tools, and created a platform where users can not only learn but also actively contribute.
    </p>

    <br>

   <p>
   If you have any questions, ideas or suggestions about AI Literacy, please do not hesitate to
